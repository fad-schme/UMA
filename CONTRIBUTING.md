# Contributing to UMA

Thank you for your interest in contributing to UMA! This guide outlines the process for contributing to the project and our development conventions.

**Feature proposals and bug reports are welcome and genuinely appreciated.**
**Code PRs are not being accepted at this stage.**
**External contributions are by invitation only.**

The team may invite an external contributor to submit a pull request when:

- the problem is well understood,
- the proposed approach aligns with the intended solution, and
- the issue is high-impact and high-priority.

Pull requests that have not been explicitly invited will be closed without review.

## Why

UMA is a memory and context SDK that sits at the storage boundary of every
agent built on it — every merged line has to be understood well enough to
reason about its trust model, not just its behaviour. Reviewing a PR against
the architectural context, isolation contracts, and roadmap direction the
author doesn't have visibility into costs more maintainer time than
implementing the fix directly. This will change as the project matures.

For now, the highest-leverage things you can do are:

- **Open a bug report.** A crisp reproduction is more valuable than a patch,
  because identifying the right fix is the hard part.
- **Propose a feature.** Open an issue describing what you need and why.
  Roadmap decisions are made based on these.
- **Share analysis in an existing thread.** Root-cause hypotheses, adjacent
  design considerations, and prior-art references genuinely help.
- **Test UMA in your own agent stack** and tell us what broke.

## Bug reports

Before filing, check that:

- You're on the latest release
- An existing issue does not already cover it
- If security-related, do **not** open a public issue — see
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

Include:

- UMA version (`python -c "import uma; print(uma.__version__)"`)
- Python version and OS
- Minimal reproduction (a `uma.yaml` snippet + a short Python script beats
  a description every time)
- What you expected vs. what happened
- Any relevant audit-log output (redacted if needed)

---

## Feature proposals

Include:

- The problem the feature solves (not the solution first)
- Which lane or subsystem it affects
- Whether it changes existing behaviour or adds new
- Any trust-model implications

---

## Community values

- **Be kind.** Written communication is hard — err on the side of generosity.
- **Assume good intent.** In both directions.
- **Say when something is unclear.** If you had to guess at how something
  works, that is a documentation bug worth filing.

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

### Development workflow (once invited)

Contributors work from a source checkout, not the PyPI release:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fad-schme/UMA.git
cd UMA
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The editable install builds UMA from the local checkout and installs the
development dependencies needed by the checks below. Requires Python 3.10+.

- Branch from `main` on a descriptive topic branch (`feat/xxx`, `fix/xxx`)
- Keep changes focused — unrelated fixes go in separate PRs
- All lint and test checks must pass locally before you push
- Each commit should compile and pass its tests

### Change contents

1. **Start with the issue.** Do not open a PR without a linked issue where
   the approach was agreed.
2. **Add or update tests.** A bug fix should include a test that fails before
   your change and passes after.
3. **Document behaviour.** If the change affects users, update the relevant
   file under `docs/` (and its counterpart in `.claude/skills/`), plus the
   `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. **Keep commits atomic.**

### Pull request

- Use the PR template: **What? Why? How?**
- Link to the issue where the approach was agreed
- Make sure the branch is up-to-date with `main`
- Mark **Ready for review** only when merge-able

### Review

1. A maintainer will be assigned as primary reviewer.
2. If the PR introduces scope not previously discussed, it may be closed.
3. Change requests are not personal — long-term maintainability wins over
   short-term completeness.
4. Once accepted, the PR is squash-merged.
